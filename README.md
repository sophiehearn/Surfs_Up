# Surfs Up - Weather Analysis in Oahu

## Overview
An analysis was conducted of the temperatures and precipitation in Oahu from 2010 to 2017 to determine the feasibility of opening up a new Surf and Ice Cream shop on the island. Surfing and ice cream sales benefit from low precipitation and high temperatures. Thus to ensure this would be a viable business opportunity, the partners wanted to ensure good weather was likely. 

## Results

This initial data set only includes temperatures from June and December, in hopes to get a sense of the weather at different times of the year. 

1700 samples were taken during June, with a mean temperature of 74.9 degrees. The minimum temperature was 64 and the max was 85.

1517 samples were taken during December, with a mean temperature of 71 degrees, a min of 56, and a max of 83. December is, of course, a chillier month than June in the Northern Hemisphere - but temperatures were still relatively warm even through the winter. It would be valuable to see a chart of ice cream sales vs temperatures in other areas if available.

## Summary 

The weather analysis that was conducted is promising for the ice cream and surf shop in Oahu. There's more data to be analyzed, of course. With regards to weather, we still have no collected the information on precipitation in June and December respectively. In Hawaii, it's common to have warm weather and rain at the same time, which would likely hurt ice cream and surifng sales.
